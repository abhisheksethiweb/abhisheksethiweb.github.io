00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Let's talk about the nature of learning.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.349
We are not born knowing much.

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.899
Over the curse of our lifetimes,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.800
we slowly gain an understanding of the world through interaction.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.700
By interacting with the world,

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.669
We learn about cause and effect or how the world responds to our actions.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.100
Once we have an understanding of how the world works,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.530
we can use our knowledge to accomplish specific goals.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.000
In this course, we'll take a stab at attaining

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.230
a scientific understanding of how this learning from interaction happens.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.410
Specifically, we'll take a computational approach called

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.794
reinforcement learning or RL for short.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.685
Since the world is quite complicated,

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:43.620
we'll simplify the world to study environments with well-defined rules and dynamics,

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.019
we'll then construct algorithms to teach

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.285
an individual in this simple world to learn from interaction.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:56.244
We'll study many of these algorithms to understand the strengths and limitations of each.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.079
We'll begin with the basics to attain

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.269
a solid foundational understanding of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.900
the basic structure behind these learning algorithms.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.394
Of course, the simplest algorithms will have significant limitations.

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:13.509
We will discuss these limitations to motivate the development of more complex techniques.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.460
Over the course of this content,

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:19.059
we'll gradually add complexity making sure that you intuitively

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.655
understand at each step of the way what these algorithms are designed to accomplish.

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:25.989
Of course, we will end with

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:27.759
the most cutting-edge techniques that are

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.575
making headlines in reinforcement learning today.

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:32.219
So let's get started.
