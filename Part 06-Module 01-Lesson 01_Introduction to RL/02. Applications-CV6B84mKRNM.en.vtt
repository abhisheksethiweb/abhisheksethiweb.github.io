00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
The applications of reinforcement learning are numerous and diverse.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.894
Ranging from self-driving cars to board games.

00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:10.559
For instance, one of the major breakthroughs in

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.290
machine learning in the 90s was TD-Gammon.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.379
An algorithm that used RL to play Backgammon

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.329
on par with the best Backgammon players at the time.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.009
This algorithm advanced the theory of Backgammon

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.710
by discovering strategies that were previously unknown.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.100
You know, Backgammon is a pretty complicated game.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.289
In fact, it has over 10 to the 20th possible game states.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.629
So it's pretty amazing that it was possible to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.140
teach an artificially intelligent agent how to play.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.674
More recently, progress was made on a game that is much more complicated.

00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:47.144
Maybe you've heard of AlphaGo.

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:51.915
An AI agent trained to beat professional Go players.

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:54.509
It's said that there are more configurations in

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:58.125
the game than there are atoms in the universe.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:03.420
RL is also used to play video games such as Atari Breakout.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.284
The AI agent is given no prior knowledge of what a ball is or what the controls do.

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:12.229
It only sees the screen and its score.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.790
Then through interacting with the game,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.695
with testing out the various controls,

00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:19.559
it's able to devise a strategy to maximize its score.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.780
RL was also used to create a bot to beat

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.155
top players in the online battle arena video game Dota.

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:28.640
If you are an e-sports fan,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.025
you're encouraged to check it out.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:33.765
Jumping to a completely different domain,

00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:36.165
RL is also used in robotics.

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:39.450
For instance, it's been used to teach robots to walk.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.750
The idea is that we can give the robot time to test out

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.484
its new legs to see what works and what doesn't work for staying upright.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:52.105
Then we can create an algorithm to help it learn from that gained experience,

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:54.579
so it's able to walk like a pro.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.329
But why teach a robot to walk when you can teach it to drive?

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.384
RL is used successfully in self-driving cars, ships, and airplanes.

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:07.320
It's even been used in finance, biology,

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.525
telecommunication, and inventory management among other things.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.455
