00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
In this course, you'll learn about many classical algorithms in reinforcement learning.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.164
You may discover that some algorithms are initially harder to conceptualize than others.

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:15.329
If at any point you'd like to have a conversation to deepen your understanding,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.824
we encourage you to start a thread in the slack channels.

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:21.660
We at Udacity believe in learning by doing.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.344
So for all of the algorithms we'll discuss,

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:26.684
you'll write your own implementations.

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.854
Just watching the videos should be enough to pass the course.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.744
But if you'd like to go above and beyond,

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.009
we have a few suggestions.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:39.974
First, the most popular textbook on reinforcement learning is available for free online.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.840
Throughout the course, we'll provide recommended readings from

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.930
this book that you can use to deepen your understanding.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.030
It's a great book and highly enjoyable to read so highly recommended.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.980
Second, you'll encounter quite a few equations while learning about RL.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.407
We'll carefully discuss the meaning behind these equations,

00:00:58.408 --> 00:00:59.939
but after the lessons finish,

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:04.554
be sure to revisit them and make sure that you can describe them in your own words.

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:06.900
Make this content yours.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.055
It won't come easily at first but I guarantee you that if you work hard,

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.530
it'll be an amazing experience.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.974
We hope you're as excited to learn about this fascinating content as we are to teach you.

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.219
But that's all for now. I'll see you in the next lesson.
