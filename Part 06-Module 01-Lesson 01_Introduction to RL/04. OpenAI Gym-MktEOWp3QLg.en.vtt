00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.874
In this course, we'll make extensive use of OpenAI Gym,

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:08.765
an open source toolkit for developing and comparing RL algorithms.

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:13.460
We'll use four of the environments that are available as part of this toolkit.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.234
The first is the frozen lake environment.

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:18.719
We will write an agent who can navigate a world

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.854
without falling into pits of frozen water.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.644
Next, you'll write an agent to play blackjack.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.169
Then, you'll work with another small world with

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.085
a large cliff where your goal is to avoid falling in.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.883
The final environment is a taxi world.

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:38.960
We will train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers as quickly as possible.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.094
One of the really cool things about

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.405
OpenAI Gym is that you can record your performance.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:49.730
So your agent might start off just behaving randomly but as it learns from interaction,

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.979
you'll be able to see it choose actions in a much more intelligent way.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.659
What's also really cool is that if you're happy with how

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.659
smart you've made your agents or how quickly they learn,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.185
you can upload your implementations to share your knowledge with the world.

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.890
But I won't keep you from it any longer.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.969
For this lab, follow the tutorial links below to learn the basic syntax.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.700
Although we won't use open agent just yet.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.120
I highly recommend following the tutorial now to build

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.484
your excitement for the kind of implementations you'll build in this course.

00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:27.015
We'll have to spend a bit of time developing that theory before jumping in.

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:30.000
But I guarantee you that it's more than worth it.
