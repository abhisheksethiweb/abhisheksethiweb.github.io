00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
Finally, we ask the question, what is network fixating on?

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.375
What is that you look at?

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.618
And you can do a sensitivity analysis.

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:07.679
You can wiggle your input image

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.019
a little bit and see how much the output class of wiggles.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.070
And for some wiggles,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.490
if you wiggle them a little bit the output does not change very much.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.160
But for others it changes a lot.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
That is called a sensitivity analysis and that gives you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
a feeling for why does no one ever pay attention.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.341
What factors are the images normally used to arrive at its conclusion.

00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:28.545
Here is a melanoma and you can see on the right side in this diagram,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.704
the darker dot the more important that feature is.

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:33.494
If you look in detail here,

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:36.359
you will see that this melanoma has already

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.674
spread a little bit and is comprised of multiple black dots.

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:41.820
And the fact that there are multiple black dots

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.179
seems to have a big impact on the vote of the

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.854
[inaudible] as shown by the corresponding dark areas in the right image.

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:53.684
Take some time and study this image over here and look at the different types

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:57.794
of skin patches and what region of those patches play a big role.

00:00:57.793 --> 00:01:00.674
All these images were classified correctly,

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:04.034
and in some cases you will see that the entire image matters; in others,

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:07.349
very specific features of being emphasis with an [inaudible] classification.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.809
The network is smart enough to really understand

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.230
what part of the image is essential for finding cancer.
