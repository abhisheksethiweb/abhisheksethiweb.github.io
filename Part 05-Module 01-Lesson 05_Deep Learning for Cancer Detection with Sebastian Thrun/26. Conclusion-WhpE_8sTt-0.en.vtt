00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
Now we publish this result in the journal Nature.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.320
In fact, it became a cover of Nature.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.919
At the time, it was the fourth most discussed nature paper ever.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.445
And it really raised a lot of questions.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.105
What is the future of medicine look like if effectively,

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:23.039
a camera-based system can outperform the best human doctors?

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.530
Now what I want to caution here a little

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.350
bit because this is a study done on images alone.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.840
And a doctor does much more than just looking at images.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.215
He knows the patient.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.265
There would be an impression of the patient and so on.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:39.140
But still, a shocking an image-based said that effectively,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.579
an iPhone does as well as a highly paid doctor.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.619
And that discussion is ongoing.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.899
The reason why I want you to do this on your own now in an exercise and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.909
experience the same phenomena with this more data set is because,

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.819
what you're learning here in this class,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.840
in Deep Learning has the potential to massively change how the society works.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.085
Many of us, many of us do the same repetitive task every day, in and out.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:12.564
We might be lawyers doing contract drafting or a legal document discovery.

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:15.584
You might be doctors trying to catch cancer.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:18.474
You might be truck drivers driving trucks.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.324
Pilots flying planes.

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:23.765
Researchers doing financial investment research on the web.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.935
Brokers, insurance brokers.

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.519
All of us do the same thing over and over again.

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.789
And what AI can do with us,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.930
it can make us super human.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.915
Given the capability of the best of demontologist and give it to everybody.

00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:40.530
The capabilities of the best accountants and give it to everybody.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.335
The capabilities of the best salespeople and give it to everybody.

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:47.310
That's going to be the pure illusion.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.629
And by you taking this course and learning how to apply deeply and interesting problems.

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:57.444
You can make people superhuman and you can probably build a business almost everywhere,

00:01:57.444 --> 00:02:00.059
where people do highly repetitive office work.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.719
I believe Deep Learning will make people five, ten,

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.590
20 times as efficient and as you become more efficient,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680
our jobs will change.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.965
A long time ago,

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:14.250
a U.S. farmer was able to feed about four people.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.514
Today, one farmer can feed 155 people in the world.

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:22.314
Today, an account might have 10 clients and 20 clients.

00:02:22.314 --> 00:02:25.599
In the future might be 150 clients, a thousand clients.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.799
If you think about this,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.120
the potential of these technology is unbelievable.
