00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
And it was also misclassify in

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.860
an experiment where we looked at

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.224
nine various classification for different types of disease,

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:09.044
including cancers which is class seven and class eight.

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:10.800
The bit of what's called a confusion matrix.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470
A confusion matrix is,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.990
suppose something is of class A,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.445
what is the probability of the network saying class B?

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:23.475
Okay. So we eat a b c d e f g 0 - 8 in this case,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.220
you get a probability of confusion.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.486
The main diagonal means nothing is confused.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:34.310
In any value of the main diagonal, shows high confusion.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.135
And what we find is,

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:39.804
that dermatologists have a higher confusion factor

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:43.630
than known volts that represents what consistent in its assessment.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.245
There's very systematic ways in which many of us might get a result wrong.

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:52.320
But if you look just visually at the confusion matrix here,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.634
dermatologist are much more inclined to misclassifying cases than the normal.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:02.074
There's an interesting side finding and that's one of the reasons why our C curve,

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:06.000
our sensitivity specificity ends up to be so much better than most dermatologist.
