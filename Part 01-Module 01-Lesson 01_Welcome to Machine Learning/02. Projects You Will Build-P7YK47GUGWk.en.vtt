00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.225
This program is built around projects.

00:00:02.225 --> 00:00:03.630
When you complete each project,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.025
you'll submitted to one of our expert reviewers who will give you personalized feedback.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.500
This project will help you gain valuable experience and

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.680
build a portfolio that you can share with potential employers.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.685
The first project is available at the start of the program.

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:19.320
In this product, you use Pandas and NumPy to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.665
analyze a real dataset of passengers on the Titanic.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:24.420
And based on this information,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.280
you'll be able to predict their survival.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.750
To heighten your understanding,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.027
and training, and testing machine learning models,

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:32.235
you will use scikit-learn and regression to

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.295
analyze the real data setup housing prices in Boston.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:38.220
You'll build and optimize a model to predict prices of housing.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.320
In the supervised learning project,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.930
your task will be to build a classification model to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.190
identify the best potential donors for a charity.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.820
You'll be able to use several classification algorithms and optimize them for quality.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.040
In the unsupervised learning project,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.905
you will study a real dataset of customers of a company.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.605
And you'll apply several and supervised learning techniques

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:01.170
in order to extract valuable information from the data.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.661
After you've gain expertise on the core algorithms of machine learning,

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.770
you'll be working on projects to strengthen

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.410
your understanding of deep and reinforcement learning.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.750
The deep learning project will have a bill to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.178
convolutional neural network to recognize dung breeds from images.

00:01:16.178 --> 00:01:18.715
Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided,

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:22.815
the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:26.850
You'll also be able to improve your sales significantly by using pretrain networks.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.940
You'll then use deep reinforcement learning to design

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.215
a simulated quadcopter that learns to take off hover and land all by itself.

00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:38.580
As a bonus, you will be able to integrate these behaviors into

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.275
a single endoin system that can autonomously fly from point A to Point B.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:45.885
Finally, in your capsule project,

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:49.830
you'll be able to distinguish yourself by building a machine learning project to solve

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.340
a problem that you are passionate about using any dataset of your choice.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.540
Our network of advisory reviewers will guide you through your proposal

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.810
face and will give you solid feedback on your model,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.960
your data, and your procedure.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.055
With these projects under your wings,

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:06.840
you'll have both the skills and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.720
the portfolio to become a successful machine learning engineer.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.780
We can't wait to see your contribution to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.000
the advancement of technology through machine learning.
