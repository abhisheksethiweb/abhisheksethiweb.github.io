00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
In the first part of this program,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.430
we'll cover the main algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.030
as well as the main techniques for making your models work well.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.685
In the first section called Model evaluation and validation,

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.729
you will learn what machine learning models are and how to train them,

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:18.795
test them and validate them.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.938
You will learn the main problems one has to deal with when training a model,

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:25.020
such as: over fitting and under fitting.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.025
And you'll be able to measure them and improve your training.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.277
Most algorithms of machine learning fall into two categories,

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:35.446
supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:39.460
Supervised learning is comprised of all the algorithms which will predict a label.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.170
We'll go deep into the algorithms of supervised learning such a decision trees,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.005
logistic regression, support Vector machines,

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.570
Naive Bayes and neural networks.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.785
In the next section, you will be learning the main unsupervised learning algorithms,

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.030
especially those involving clustering and dimensionality reduction.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.980
These are useful when our data comes with

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.550
no labels and we need to find properties about it.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.180
You'll be able to apply these algorithms on real data sets as well.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.195
In the second part of the nanodegree program,

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:12.270
you will go much deeper into cutting edge topics in machine learning,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.609
such as; Deep learning and reinforcement learning.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.940
Neural networks have been crucial in most of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940
the recent advances in machine learning including Alpha go,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.685
IBM Watson and self driving cars.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:27.685
In the next section, you'll get a solid foundation of deep neural networks.

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.275
You'll also learn convolutional neural networks use from many applications,

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:33.931
but in particular, for image recognition.

00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:37.780
Reinforcement learning is an interesting form of machine learning

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.870
where do you train an intelligent agent to perform actions in an environment,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.670
Instead of predicting labels or values.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.650
You'll get to use state of the art platforms,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.830
like open the EyeGym and cutting edge deep reinforcement

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.557
learning algorithms like deep Q-networks to solve challenging problems.

00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:56.175
After completing this program,

00:01:56.175 --> 00:02:00.560
you'll have a solid foundation in the main algorithms used in machine learning today.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.550
See you in class.
