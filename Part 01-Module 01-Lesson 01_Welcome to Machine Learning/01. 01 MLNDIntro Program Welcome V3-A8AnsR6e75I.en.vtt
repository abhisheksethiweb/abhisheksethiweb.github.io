00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
Hello and welcome to The Machine Learning engineer nano-degree program, I'm Luis Serrano.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.350
I'm Arpen Chakraborty.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.030
And we are the program's lead instructors.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.610
Machine learning is becoming indispensable to companies across

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.900
all industries and new applications are being devised every day.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.410
You may have heard about how Netflix recommends movies based on your tastes or how

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
Facebook is using machine learning to automatically tag faces and pictures.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.180
But machine learning is not just relevant in consumer applications,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.111
it's also changing how large enterprises operate.

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:33.450
Google is using predictive modeling to reduce their data center

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.030
operating costs and PayPal is using

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.330
deep neural networks to detect fraudulent transactions.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.830
Accordingly, machine learning engineers are consistently some of the most in demand jobs,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.345
particularly in the tech world.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.960
The goal of this program is to help you develop all the skills you need

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.150
to start or advance your career as a machine learning engineer.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.025
Not only will you learn the concepts of machine learning in detail,

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:59.505
but you'll also graduate with a portfolio of real world projects,

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:03.470
where you'll use machine learning algorithms to analyze real data.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.530
Udacity's network of subject matter experts will review your projects and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.380
give you invaluable feedback to support mastery of these new skill sets.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.190
This program has been built for students with some math and coding knowledge.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.265
If you're comfortable with derivative and matrices and you can do some coding in Python,

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:23.895
Java, C, or any language, you're ready to start.

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.910
In this program, you'll learn what a machine learning model

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.455
is and what are the main algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning.

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:36.390
You'll learn how to train and test algorithms and how to evaluate and validate them.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.030
You'll get a solid knowledge of the main algorithms of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.180
supervised machine learning including linear logistic regression,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.701
decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks.

00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.860
Also you'll learn the main algorithms of

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.500
unsupervised learning including clustering and dimensionality reduction.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.600
And then, we'll dig deep into two topics,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.230
deep learning and reinforcement learning.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.140
In deep learning, you'll learn deep neural networks and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.640
convolutional neural networks used primarily for image recognition.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.590
Then, you'll learn reinforcement learning,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.220
where you will train agents to carry out optimal actions starting

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.090
with mark-off decision processes and classic reinforcement learning algorithms,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.740
progressing to cutting edge deep reinforcement learning.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.750
And at the end, you will be able to apply all you've learned to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.965
a problem and data set of your choice in your capstone project.

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.195
Now, don't worry if that sounds daunting,

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:31.380
you'll get feedback from our network of expert reviewers along

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.915
the way to guide you and help you make your capstone project a reality.

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:39.085
When you complete this program you'll graduate ready to get a job as

00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:41.010
a machine learning engineer or to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.770
continue your journey in the world of machine learning, cheers.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.098
Cheers.
