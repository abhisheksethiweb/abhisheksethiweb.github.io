00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Hi and welcome back.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.540
I hope you enjoyed the first lesson and walked away with

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.559
an understanding of how reinforcement learning is used in industry today.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.475
So far, we've started a conversation to illustrate

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:16.669
the diverse potential of reinforcement learning techniques.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.915
In this lesson, we'll continue the conversation and

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:24.589
end with a rigorous definition for the reinforcement learning problem.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.949
Specifically, you'll learn how to take a real world problem and

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.390
formulate it so it can be solved through reinforcement learning.
