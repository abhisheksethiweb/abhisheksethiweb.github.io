00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.724
So far, you've implemented Sarsa and Sarsamax and we'lll now discuss one more option.

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:11.137
This new option is called expected Sarsa and it closely resembles Sarsamax,

00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:14.980
where the only difference is in the update step for the action value.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.719
Remember that Sarsamax or Q learning took the maximum

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.734
over all actions of all possible next state action pairs.

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:26.129
In other words, it chooses what value to place here by plugging in

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:32.054
the one action that maximizes the action value estimate corresponding to the next state.

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:35.570
Expected Sarsa does something a bit different.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.210
It uses the expected value of the next state action pair,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.750
where the expectation takes into account the probability that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.445
the agent selects each possible action from the next state.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.024
Over the next couple concepts,

00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:50.730
you'll write your own implementation of Expected Sarsa.
