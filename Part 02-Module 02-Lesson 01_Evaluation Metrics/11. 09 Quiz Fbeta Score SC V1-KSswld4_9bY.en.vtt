00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
Now that we learned F1 score,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:05.719
let's introduce something a bit more general. Here's the concept.

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.980
If we have precision over here and recall over here,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.475
then F1 score is somewhere around the middle.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.515
That gives us much importance to both.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.040
Of course, if one of them is smaller,

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.799
it raises a flag, but it treats them both the same.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.320
Now let's say our model cares a bit more about precision than recall,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.914
then we want something more skewed towards precision.

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:27.399
So, we'll say it's F0.5 score.

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.714
So we call that beta.

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:31.629
Beta is 0.5. The smaller the beta,

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.629
the more towards precision that we get.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.140
Or if we want our model to care more about the recall than one or other direction,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.295
we pick a larger beta.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:39.579
Say beta equals 2,

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.574
so our metric is F2.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.480
If you like formulas, here they are.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.579
Remember that the F1 score is 2 times precision times recall,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.989
divided by precision plus recall.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.760
The formula for beta, you just introduce a beta over here,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.059
that will skew your formula towards either one or the other one,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.170
depending on if beta is small or large. So, let's see.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.304
If we have the fraud detection example,

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:04.189
which beta should we use?

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.370
I would initially think that this needs to be a high recall model,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.530
since we need to catch all the fraud cases,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.305
and it's okay if we accidentally detect and investigate some that are not.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.895
So something like F10.

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:17.310
But then maybe, we're sacrificing too much precision,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.165
and we're accidentally sending our customers

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:22.700
too many notifications about their transactions without them being fraudulent,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.780
and they're starting to get annoyed.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.185
So, we can move a bit toward say F2.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.939
But then maybe we discover that we need to focus a bit more on

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.118
recall because we really don't want to miss too many fraudulent transactions,

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.435
so we go here to F5.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:36.210
It's not an exact science.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.899
Finding a good value of beta requires a lot

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.965
of intuition of your data and a lot of experimentation.

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.350
Now, let's test our knowledge. Let's have a quiz.

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.844
So, let's look at three possible models.

00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:48.450
In the first one, we are NASA,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.424
and we have a model for detecting malfunctioning parts on a spaceship.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:55.469
In the second, we have a video recommender system,

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.000
and we have a model for sending users phone notifications about new videos they may like.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.870
And in the third one, we are a store,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.760
and we have a model for sending free samples in the mail to potential clients.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.830
And let's say one of them has an F beta score of F1,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.020
the other one is F0.5,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.825
and the other one is F2.

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:16.009
Which one is which?
