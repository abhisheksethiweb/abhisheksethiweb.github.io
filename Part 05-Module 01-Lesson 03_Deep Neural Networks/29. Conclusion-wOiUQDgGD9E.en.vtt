00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
Congratulations. You've gone through the entire deep neural networks introduction.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.675
I am super, super proud of you.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.495
Now, you know what neural networks are,

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.640
how to build them, train them,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.395
and optimize their performance.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:15.540
You are fully equipped to go through the rest of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.660
the class learning interesting cutting edge applications,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.600
such as image recognition and sequence generation.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll see you in the next session.
