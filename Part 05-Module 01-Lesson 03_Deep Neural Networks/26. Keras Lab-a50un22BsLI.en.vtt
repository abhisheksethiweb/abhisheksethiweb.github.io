Now, this is your turn to shine.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:03.604
In the following Karris lab,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:06.410
we'll be applying all we've learned so far in order to build

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.339
a neural network that will help us analyze actual real data.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.535
The data consists of thousands of movie reviews from IMDb,

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:17.515
and the challenge will consist of predicting the sentiment of the review.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:20.000
Ready, set, go.
