Hi, am Kathleen, I lead the career team at Udacity.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.669
We support students in their job search.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.119
The careers team knows what employers are looking for in a job candidate and we

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.629
want to work with you to market yourself as the best person for the job,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.960
whether it's a new role or a promotion at your current company.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.265
You need to be proactive in your career development to be job ready at graduation.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:24.285
For this reason, career services are available throughout your Nanodegree experience.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:25.995
It's important to remember,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.829
while you're here to learn the technical skills for a job,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.199
it's equally important to know how to communicate

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.689
those skills to an employer through an application,

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.729
your online profiles, and in interviews.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.154
Let's meet the Careers team will be with you along the way.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:41.710
Hi I'm Rachel. Along with a network of career mentors,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.060
our team is here to help you from when you begin

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.965
to look for jobs until you accept your job offer.

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:51.079
Career support is present at different stages throughout your Nanodegree and we

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.379
encourage you to go through all of them regardless of where you are in your job search.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.670
Udacity career services include guides, lessons,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.820
and personalized feedback on topics like talking to recruiters,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.930
interviewing, and optimizing your online profiles.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.185
I'm Trinh. In order to graduate career ready,

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:10.790
you should continuously work on your career development.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.385
Like with all learning, beginning something earlier

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.450
means you're more prepared when it's time to apply that learning.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.230
When your dream job pops up,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.549
you want to be ready for it.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.179
Hi, I'm Kirsten, and I head up employer relations at Udacity.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.415
Once you've completed the career curriculum,

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:28.540
you'll be ready to apply to jobs and talk with employers.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.394
Udacity partners with industry leading companies,

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:35.405
who are looking to hire skilled and passionate people, like you.

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:37.594
Having hiring partners means you'll have

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:40.700
direct and preferential exposure at these companies.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.239
This will help give you a leg up in your job search,

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:47.449
as you explore your career options and develop a career path you need to you,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.650
your passion, your location,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.120
and other career goals.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.689
After you complete your first core Nanodegree projects,

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.189
you'll then be prompted to begin your career development with us.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219
We'll be there with you from then on as you

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.784
explore your career options and pursue your dream role.

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:03.030
We look forward to working with you.
