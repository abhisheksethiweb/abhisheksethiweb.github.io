00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.170
Well, let's first look at gender.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.075
If we split them by gender, then
the females downloaded Pokemon Go and

00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:11.550
WhatsApp and the males downloaded
Pokemon Go and Snapchat.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330
So, there's not much of a split there.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.050
But if we look at age,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.170
we realize that everybody under 20
year old downloaded Pokemon Go.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.610
And everybody who is 20 or older didn't.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.050
This is a nice split.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.490
So the feature that best
splits the data is age.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.369
Therefore, if you said age,
that is correct.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.520
So what we'll do is we
add a question here.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.549
The question is,
are you younger than 20?

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.120
If you are,
then we'll recommend Pokemon Go to you.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.080
If not, then we'll see.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.740
If you're 20 older,
then we'll look at the gender.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.785
It seems that if you are a female,
then you downloaded WhatsApp.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.270
And if you are a male,
you downloaded Snapchat.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.083
So we add another question here.

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:03.890
Which is, are you female or male?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.093
If you're a female,
then we recommend you WhatsApp.

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:09.830
And if you're a male,
then we recommend you Snapchat.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.250
What we end up here,
is with a Decision Tree.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.000
The decisions are given by
the questions we asked.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.690
And this Decision Tree
was built with this data.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.457
And now, whenever we have a new user, we
can put them through this Decision Tree.

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:31.110
And recommend them whatever app
the tree suggests to recommend.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360
If it's a person under 20,
we recommend them Pokemon Go.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.270
If it's a person who is 20 or
older, then we check the gender.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.116
If it's a female,
then we recommend her WhatsApp.

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:45.820
And if it's a male,
then we recommend him Snapchat.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.320
Obviously, there won't always be
a tree that perfectly fits our data.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.220
But in this class, we're going to
learn an algorithm which will help

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.110
us find the best fitting
tree to a table of data.
