00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.839
This is not an easy question.

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.359
So let's actually make a table
with the values of these equations

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.850
on each of the four points.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.679
Here we have the four
points on the top row.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.660
And now, each of the other rows
will be one of the functions.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.660
Here's x + y.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.471
We fill in the first row as follows,
0 plus 3 equals,

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:27.100
1 plus 2 equals 3, 2 plus 1 equals 3,
and 3 plus 0 equals 3.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.289
So, we see that x + y, or

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.418
the sum of the two coordinates is 3 for
each one of the points.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.850
For the second row we see that
the products are 0 times 3 equals 0 for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.055
the first one.

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:45.224
1 times 2 equals 2 for the second.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:51.956
2 times 1 equals 2 for the third, and
3 times 0 equals 0 for the fourth.

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:56.441
And for the last one x squared
we see that 0 squared equals 0,

00:00:56.441 --> 00:01:01.630
1 squared equals 1, 2 squared equals 4,
and 3 squared equals 9.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.670
So let's think, which of these equations
separates the green and the red points.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.740
We look at the sum x + y and
that gives us 3 at every value, so

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.079
it doesn't really separates them.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.459
If we look at x squared, so the first
coordinates squared, we get 0 and 9 for

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.089
the red values and 1 and
4 for the green values.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.974
This one also doesn't separate them
since the red values are small and

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:34.134
large 0 and 9 and
the green values are in between 1 and 4.

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:37.064
So we look at the product xy and
that gives us 0 for

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:40.039
the red values, and
2 for the green ones.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.800
So, it seems that this one does a job,
right?

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.739
Since it’s a function that gives
us one value for the red point and

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.729
another value from
the green points then,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.719
it’s a function that can tell red and
green apart.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.759
So, if you said xy, that is correct.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.750
That is the magic equation we'll use.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.990
So let's see, here we have our 4
points with coordinates x,y and

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.634
a products of the coordinates xy.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.602
So for the, red points x, y,
we have that the product xy = 0.

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:18.066
And for the green points, x, y,
we have that the product xy = 2.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:20.367
And what separates a 0 and a 2?

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:26.774
Well, a 1, so
the equation xy = 1 will separate them.

00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:29.640
And what is xy = 1?

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.039
It's the same as y = 1/x,
and the graph for

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.429
y = 1/x is precisely
this hyperbola over here.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.960
That is the curve we wanted.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.949
Okay, now let's look at what
happens in three dimensions.

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:49.074
And we recall that our magic equation,
which will separate the points is xy.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:57.609
So we have our points with coordinates
(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0).

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.974
And here we have a copy of the plane
with an extra axis, the axis z, for

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:02.590
height.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.929
So let's add this magic equation,
xy, to our coordinate.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.969
In other words, let's consider the map
from two dimensions to three dimensions,

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:19.080
which takes the point in the plane with
coordinates (x, y) to the point in space

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.750
with coordinates( x, y, xy).

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.582
This map says the point (0,
3) to the point (0, 3, 0).

00:03:30.582 --> 00:03:35.507
The point (1, 2) to the point (1, 2, 2).

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:40.227
The point (2, 1) to the point (2, 1, 2).

00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:44.490
And the point (3, 0),
to the point (3, 0, 0).

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.358
So in a different way, it still
separates the point since it sends

00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:53.039
the green points up by 2, and
it leaves the red points underneath.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.449
Now what could separate these points?

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.989
Well a plane could do it.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.610
This is the way to visualize
the kernel trick in three dimensions.
