00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.550
Okay, now we're going to learn
another very powerful method to split

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.340
points in the plane.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.290
So let's say we have thee four
points arranged like this and

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.760
we want to split them.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.840
It seems again that
a line won't do the job

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.460
since they're already over the line and
the red ones are on the sides.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.100
So we need to think outside the box.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.590
One way to think out of the box is to
use a curve like this to split them.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.440
Another one is to actually
think outside the plane.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.170
And think of the points as lying
in three dimensional space.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.080
Here are the four points over the plane.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.040
We add an extra axis,
the z axis for the third dimension.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.700
And if we can find a way to
lift the two green points,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940
then we'd be able to
separate them with a plane.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.710
So what seems like the better solution,
to think within the plane and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.220
separate the points with a curve?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.400
Or to think of the points in space,
and separate them with a plane?

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.572
Well, it turns out that these two
are actually the same method.

00:00:58.572 --> 00:01:02.475
Don't worry if it seems confusing,
we'll see it in more detail later.

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:04.665
This method is called the Kernel Trick,
and

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.965
it's very well used in
support vector machines.

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:12.820
Okay, so let's study one of them in more
detail, let's study the curve trick.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.610
First, let's start by putting
coordinates on the points.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.310
So this one is (0,3).

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.130
This one is (1,2).

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.220
This one is (2,1).

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.202
And this one is (3,0).

00:01:23.202 --> 00:01:27.750
And what we need is a way to separate
the green points from the red points.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.890
So if the points coordinates are (x,y),
maybe we need an equation

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.160
on the variables x and
y that gives us large values for

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.130
the green points and small values for
the red points, or vice versa.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.861
So which of the following equations
could come to our rescue?

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:44.647
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:50.110
The sum of the two coordinates x + y,
the product of the coordinates,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.830
xy or the first coordinates squared,
x squared.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.240
