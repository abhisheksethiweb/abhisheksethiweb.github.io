00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.850
Now let's say we're the admissions
office at a university, and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.980
we're trying to figure out
which students to admit.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.780
We're going to admit them or reject
them based on two pieces of information,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.770
an entrance test we provide them,
and their grades from school.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.460
So for example, here we have student
one with scores of nine in test and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.590
eight in the grades, and
that student got accepted.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.180
We also have student two with
scores of three in the test and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.790
four in the grades and
that student did not get accepted.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.120
And then a new student comes in,
student three.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.460
This person scores seven and six, and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.010
the question is should we accept them or
not?

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.565
So to decide this, let's first put them
in a grid where the x axis represents

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:46.500
the score on the test and
the y axis represents the grades.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.620
Here we can see that student one
would lie over here on the point with

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.480
coordinates nine, eight, and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.850
student two would lie over here in the
point with coordinates three and four.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.570
So in order to see if
we should accept or

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.000
reject student three,
we'll try to find the trend in the data.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.280
For this we'll look at previous data in
the form of all students we've already

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.950
accepted or rejected.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.490
It turns out that the previous
data looks like this.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.050
The green dots represent students
that was previously accepted and

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.970
the red dots represent students
that was previously rejected.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.080
Okay, so time for a quiz.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.330
Based on this previous data do we
think student three gets accepted?

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.160
Yes or no?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.550
