00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.590
Here's a way to group the houses which
doesn't require us to specify the number

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.790
of clusters beforehand.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.010
Let's say the houses
are arranged like this.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.000
It would make sense
to say the following,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.180
if two houses are close they should
be served by the same pizza parlor.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.000
So going by this philosophy
let's try to group the houses.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.520
Let's look at which houses
are the closest to each other.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.160
It's these two over here,
so we group those two.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.730
Now, which are the next
two closest houses?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.170
It's these two over here,
so we group them.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.419
The next two closest houses are these
two, so we group them and we keep going.

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:42.970
The next two closest houses are here and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.330
now something funny happens because
one house is already grouped.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.900
What we do, is we join the clusters
containing each of the houses.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.030
The next two clusters are here,
so we join the respective groups.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.280
The next two are here,
so we joined our groups.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.550
And now the next two closest
houses are these two over here.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.800
But that's already too far.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.140
So let's stop there.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.920
What we did here is we picked
a distance to begin with and said,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.050
whenever the two closest houses are this
distance apart we'll stop the algorithm.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.160
That will control how far we
want the clusters to be apart.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.630
This algorithm is known as
hierarchical clustering.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.600
So we can see that hierarchical
clustering is useful

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.790
when we may not know
the number of clusters, but

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.490
we have an idea about how
far we want them to be.
