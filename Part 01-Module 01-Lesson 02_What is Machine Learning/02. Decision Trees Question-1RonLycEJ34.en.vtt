00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.100
Okay, so we'll start with an example.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.310
We are the apps store or Google Play.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.688
And our goal is to
recommend apps to users.

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:10.090
So to each user,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.670
we're going to try to recommend them the
app they are most likely to download.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.890
So here we have a table of data that
we're going to use to make the rules.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.980
And the table contains six people.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.690
And for each one of these six people,
we have recorded their gender, and

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.460
their age, and the app they downloaded.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.028
So for example, the first person
is a 15 year old female, and

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:35.980
she downloaded Pokemon Go.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.966
So here's a quiz.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:42.940
Between gender and age, which

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.790
one seems more decisive for predicting
what app will the users download?

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.180
