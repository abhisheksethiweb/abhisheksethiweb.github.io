00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.750
Okay, now we're going to
look at another example.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.840
We are going to build an email
spam detection classifier.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.540
And how do we do it?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.123
We do it by looking at previous data.

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:15.839
The previous data is 100 emails
that we've already looked that.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.698
Out of these 100 emails, we have
manually flagged 25 of them as spam,

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:24.150
and 75 of them as non-spam.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.490
Now let's try to think of features that
a spam email may be likely to display

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.370
and analyze its features.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.010
One feature can be for
example containing the word cheap.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.200
It seems reasonable to think that
an e-mail that contains the word cheap

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.405
is likely to be spam.

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:43.250
So, let's analyze this claim.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.010
We look for the word cheap in at least
100 emails and find that 20 out of

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.240
the 25 spam ones and five out of the 75
non-spam ones contained the word.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.510
So, we forget about
the rest of the emails and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.380
focus only on the ones that
contained the word cheap.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.720
Okay, so time for a quiz.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.313
Here is the question.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:09.467
Based on our data,
if an email contains the word cheap,

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:14.083
what is the probability
of this email being spam?

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:19.420
Is it 40%, 60%, or 80%?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.300
Submit your answer below.
