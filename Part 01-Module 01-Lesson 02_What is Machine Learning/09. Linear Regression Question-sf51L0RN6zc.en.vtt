00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.460
So let's say we're studying the housing market and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.801
our task is to predict the price of a house given its size.

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.419
So we have a small house that costs $70,000,

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.641
and a big house that costs $160,000.

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:16.164
We'd like to estimate the price of this medium-sized house over here.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.005
So how do we do it?

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.474
Well, first we put them in a grid where the x axis represents the size of

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:27.970
the house in square feet and the y axis represents the price of the house.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.719
And to help us out,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.000
we have collected some previous data in the form of these blue dots.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.689
These are other houses that we've looked at and

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.939
we've recorded their prices with respect to their size.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:44.189
In here we can see the small house is priced at $70,000.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.381
And the big one at $160,000.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.619
Now, it's time for a small quiz.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.621
What do you think is the best estimate for the price of the medium house,

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.630
given these data?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:02.206
Would it be $80,000, $120,000, or $190,000?

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:04.489
