00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.220
Congratulations, together
we've learned many

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.120
main algorithms used
in machine learning.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.240
We learned to predict house
prices using Linear Regression,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.120
to detect spam email using Naive Bayes,
to recommend apps using Decision Trees.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.870
We learned to create a model for

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
an admissions office using a Logistic
Regression and Support Vector Machines

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
and we learn how to improve it using
Neutral Networks and the Kernel method.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.833
And finally we learned how to locate
pizza parlors around the city using

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.364
clustering algorithms.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.970
So many questions may
arise in your head,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.959
such as are there more algorithms and
the answer to that is yes.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.620
Which algorithm to use?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.680
So if I give you a dataset,
how do you know which algorithm to pick.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.202
So we learn how to compare them based
on many things like running time,

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:50.617
accuracy, etc.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.661
Can I combine these algorithms?

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:53.948
The answer is totally.

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:55.123
[MUSIC]

00:00:55.123 --> 00:00:57.628
Will I get to work with real-life data?

00:00:57.628 --> 00:01:02.385
Absolutely our projects will get you to
analyze existing data to solve real life

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:03.100
problems.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.490
I look forward to answering these and
many more questions in learning together

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.540
in Udacity's machine learning
nano degree program.
