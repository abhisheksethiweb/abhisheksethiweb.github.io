Hi, welcome to Udacity's machine
learning nano degree program.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.820
My name is Luis Serrano and
I'm a Course Developer here at Udacity.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.610
But before I worked here I was working
on machine learning at Google for

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.690
a few years.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.079
I was using machine learning algorithms
to generate video recommendations at

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.230
YouTube.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.220
Machine learning is widely used for
many cool things.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.970
Such as image and
voice recognition, spam detection,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.990
fraud detection, stock market, teaching
a computer how to play chess, and,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.520
of course, self-driving cars.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.560
So it may sound like something so
useful must be pretty complicated.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.170
But I'm here to show you that machine
learning is actually pretty easy.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.140
And most importantly a lot of fun.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.550
So first off, what is machine learning?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.620
Well, we have the world and in the world
we have humans and we have computers.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.040
And one of the main
differences between humans and

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.240
computers is that humans
learn from past experiences.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.060
Whereas computers need to be told what
to do, they need to be programmed.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.690
And now the question is, can we get
computers to learn from experience too?

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.280
And the answer is yes, we can.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030
And that is precisely
what machine learning is.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.273
Teaching computers to learn to
perform tasks from past experiences.

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:24.804
Of course, for computers past
experiences are just recorded as data.

00:01:24.804 --> 00:01:28.742
So together, we're going to look at
a few examples in which we can teach

00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:31.118
the computer to learn
from previous data.

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:34.624
And most importantly, I'm going to show
you that machine learning is actually

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.209
pretty easy, and nothing to fear.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.709
