Okay, so let's dive in a bit deeper
into the art of splitting data into two.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.940
We look at these six points and there
seem to be many lines that split them.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.740
For example, there's this blue one and
there is this yellow one.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.480
So here's a quiz.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.430
Which of these two lines do we
think cuts the data better?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.190
The yellow one or the blue one?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.560
Submit your answer below.
