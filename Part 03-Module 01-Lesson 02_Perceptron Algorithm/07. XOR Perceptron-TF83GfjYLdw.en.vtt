00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.064
Now, I'm going to leave you with a question.

00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:03.629
Here is the XOR perceptron,

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.719
which is very similar to the other two except this one returns a true

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.335
if exactly one of them is true and the other one is false.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.380
So it returns this table.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.199
Now, the question is can we turn this into a perceptron.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.140
These four points seem hard to be separated by a line.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.195
We'll see what we can do in the quiz.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:24.285
But in a nutshell the idea is the following.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:29.190
We'll be combining perception so that the output of one becomes the input of another one.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.539
This is what forms a multi-layer perception or a neural network.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.019
We'll elaborate on these later in the class.
