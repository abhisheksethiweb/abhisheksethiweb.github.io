00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.512
In this section, we learn about how to train different models in

00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:07.109
a scale learn and how to play with parameters in order to train our model better.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.894
As you can imagine, as the data gets bigger and more complicated,

00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.744
this process of picking the right algorithm

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.174
and the right parameters can get pretty tedious.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:18.344
In fact, there are many techniques that we can use to help us with these decisions.

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.445
This is what we learn in the rest of this section.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.115
How to train, test, evaluate,

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:26.289
and validate models in order to make the best decisions with our data.
