Congratulations.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.998
This is the end of the supervised learning section.

00:00:03.998 --> 00:00:07.335
Now, you know some of the most important algorithms in supervised learning.

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.540
Next, you'll have the project where you'll be able to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.790
apply these algorithms on a real dataset,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.470
compare their performances, and optimize your training methods. Ready to go?
