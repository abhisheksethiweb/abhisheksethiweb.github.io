00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.294
Now, in order to combine models,

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:05.344
we'll actually weight them by how well they're doing.

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:09.509
In this way, if one of our friends just answers the questions better,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.369
we'll believe that friend more.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.695
So let's turn to a hypothetical question.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.005
We have three friends.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.125
One always tells the truth,

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.195
the other one tells the truth half of the time and lies half of the time,

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.684
and we don't know which half,

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:24.974
and the third one always lies.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:29.785
The question is, which one of these three is the one that we should ignore the most?

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.039
Equivalently, here we have three models.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.140
The first one is always correct,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.649
the second one is correct half of the time,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.354
and the third one is wrong every single time.

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:42.189
Which of these models is worse for us?

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:44.129
