00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
You've already learned about how to formulate

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:06.815
a real world problem so it can be solved with reinforcement learning.

00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:11.785
In this lesson, you'll begin to think about ways to solve this problem.

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:13.859
It's important to note that this lesson is

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.309
significantly more technical than the previous one.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.529
If this is initially uncomfortable to you,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.645
don't worry and feel free to take the videos at your own pace.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.300
We've added extensive examples and quizzes

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.390
to help you through this relatively difficult content,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.299
but you'll likely still need to take your own notes

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:37.314
to make sure that the terminology becomes natural to you.

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:42.112
You should think of reinforcement learning as a language that takes time to learn.

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:45.789
So, don't be too hard on yourself and you could always collaborate with

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.079
their classmates on Slack or ask questions in office hours.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.000
With all of this in mind, let's get started.
