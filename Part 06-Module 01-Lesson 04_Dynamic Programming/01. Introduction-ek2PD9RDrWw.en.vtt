00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.029
For this lesson, we'll confine our attention to

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.275
a problem that's slightly easier than the reinforcement learning problem.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:11.685
Instead of working in a setting where the agent has to learn from interaction,

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:16.000
we'll assume that the agent already knows everything about the environment.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.875
So the agent knows how the environment decides the next state,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.211
and it knows how the environment decides reward.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:25.504
The goal will remain the same.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:30.359
Given this information, the agent would like to find the optimal policy.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.740
Solving the simpler problem first will prove incredibly useful for building

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.535
intuition before we tackle the full reinforcement learning problem.

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:42.329
With this in mind, I'll catch you in the next video.
