00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
So far, we've discussed how we might design the algorithm for Monte Carlo control.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.130
I mentioned in the last video that we

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.385
still have some work to do with the evaluation step.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:14.820
Towards this end, we discussed an algorithm for keeping

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.675
a running estimate of the mean of a sequence of numbers.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.160
Remember that this algorithm focused on one state action pair,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.079
which was visited some number and times.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.195
The algorithm looks at each visit in order and successively updates the mean new.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:35.737
So this algorithm currently,

00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:41.549
can only update the value function estimate corresponding to a single state action pair.

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.439
Our next step is to change it a bit,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.384
so that it can maintain estimates of values for many state action pairs.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:51.539
Then, we'll be able to plug in that algorithm as

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.435
a new and improved evaluation step. So here's what we'll do.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:01:01.005
The agent begins by sampling an episode from the environment.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:06.915
Then, for every time step we look at the corresponding state action pair.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:08.190
If it's a first visit,

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.724
we calculate the corresponding return.

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:15.619
Then, in accordance with the algorithm we examined for keeping the running mean,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.785
we then just update the corresponding estimate of the action value.

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:25.090
And so when we go to plug in this stuff into our algorithm for our Monte Carlo control,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.320
we also have to be careful to also initialize the number

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.339
of times we've visited each pair and we're getting there.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.829
Your blackjack playing agent will soon have

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.069
a method for improving its strategy after every game.
