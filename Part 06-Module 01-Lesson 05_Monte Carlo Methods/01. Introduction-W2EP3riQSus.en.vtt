00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
So far, you've learned all about the Reinforcement Learning Framework.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:05.835
You've learned about agents,

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.120
and environments, and how we specify MDPs.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.674
In the previous lesson,

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:14.425
you looked at a simplification of the Reinforcement Learning problem.

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:16.620
In the Dynamic Programming setting,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.984
the agent already had full knowledge of the environments dynamics.

00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:24.059
But in this lesson, and for all remaining lessons,

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.759
we'll consider the Reinforcement Learning problem where

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
the agent is not given full knowledge of how the environment operates,

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.579
and instead, must learn from interaction.
