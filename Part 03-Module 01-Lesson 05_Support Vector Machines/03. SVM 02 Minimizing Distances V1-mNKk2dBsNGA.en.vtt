00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
So, if you said the line on the left, you are correct.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.690
Because as you can see,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.429
the yellow line is pretty well-spaced

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.469
between the blue points and the red points, whereas,

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:08.789
the green line is not,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.309
because it's a little too close to some of the points on both sides.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.370
And how can we see this? Well, we look at

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.500
all the distances between the closest point to one

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.059
of the lines and compare them to

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.939
the distances between the closest points to the other line.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.429
So, the closest point to the yellow line is this one and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.039
the closest point to the green line is this one over here.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.804
And then, we check, which one of these closest points is actually farther from the line?

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:32.399
So, we compare these two distances and we see

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.475
that the one on the left is bigger, so that line wins.

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.995
In a nutshell, this is how an SVM works.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.390
But throughout this lesson, I'll be showing you this algorithm in more detail.
