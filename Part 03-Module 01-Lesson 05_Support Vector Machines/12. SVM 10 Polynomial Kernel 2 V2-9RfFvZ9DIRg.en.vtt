00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
Okay, so the kernel method was interesting,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:06.719
but it gets really pretty when we look at it in higher dimensions. Check this out.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:08.490
Let's say we have these points,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.951
the red and the blue,

00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:11.429
and we want to split them.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.605
The coordinates are these for the red points,

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.150
and this for the blue points.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.190
So again, we try to split them with a line,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.075
and quickly realize that there is no line that can separate these points.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.519
So, we need something a bit more complicated,

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.439
and we'll use the Kernel Trick again.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.035
I am going to show you two ways to do this.

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:30.015
One, is to use a circular boundary.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:33.329
So, a circle that separates the blue points from the red points.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.059
And the other one, is to think outside the plane.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.804
So again, to think in higher dimensions.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.179
We'll now introduce a third axis, the z axis.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.505
And now we can think that we're living in a building,

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:46.710
and we're going to send the blue points to say,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.210
the second floor of the building,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.804
and the red points to say the 18th floor.

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:53.393
And now, we're going to put a boundary on the tenth floor,

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:55.560
and that's how we're going to separate the points.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.450
These two and 18 are not arbitrary.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.905
We'll see how they appear later.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:00.570
So, basically we have two methods.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.149
The circle method which sacrifices the linearity,

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.739
and instead of using a linear equation,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.109
it uses a higher degree polynomial equation.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.650
And the building method which sacrifices the dimensionality of the data,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.750
and now you don't have data in two dimensions,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.775
instead you have it in three dimensions.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.920
You still have linear boundaries in this method,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.570
but you have more dimensions.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.399
So the question is,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.908
which one do you like more?

00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:24.000
The circle or the building method?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.424
I'll let you think about it.

00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:28.384
And I'll tell you,

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:29.885
they're actually the same method,

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.565
and this is the kernel method.

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:33.694
And I'll show you why they are the same.

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.449
So, let's look at the points again,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
and as we saw no linear function can separate them.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.875
So, maybe we need a different function to help us separate them. And here's a quiz.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.329
It's not a super-easy quiz.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.875
So, I'd like you to think about it.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.200
Which equation on the variables x and y,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.805
the two coordinates of the point,

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:53.390
could come to our rescue when it comes to separating the points?

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.224
The sum of the coordinates x plus y,

00:01:56.224 --> 00:01:59.254
the product of the coordinates x times y,

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:01.459
or the sum of the squares of the coordinates,

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.394
x squared plus y squared?

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:06.530
So, think about it. If x and y are the coordinates of the point,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.430
which one of these three functions can help us separate the points?

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.750
Enter your answer below.
