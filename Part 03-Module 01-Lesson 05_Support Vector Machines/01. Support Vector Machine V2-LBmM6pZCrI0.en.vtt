Hello again and welcome to the support vector machine section.

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:06.000
Support vector machines are a very powerful algorithm

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.030
for classification that not only aims to classify the data,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.315
but it also aims to find the best possible boundary, namely,

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.200
the one that maintains the largest distance from the points. Let's see how it works.
