00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.556
So, let's recall what classification means.

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:06.060
Classification means we have some blue points and some red points,

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.279
and we want to find a boundary that separates them.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.899
So now, we want a little more.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.000
We actually want the boundary to be as far away from the points as possible.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.149
So, what we do is we add these other two boundaries

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.649
that you can see as equidistant parallel lines to the main line,

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:26.234
and we'll try to maximize the distance between these two or the margin,

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.289
but this set is very nicely separable.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.820
Let's look at one that is slightly more complicated.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.865
Let's look at this set over here.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.160
So again, a normal classification algorithm

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.854
would just find a boundary that splits these points,

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.554
but we want a bit more.

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:43.344
We want a boundary with a margin as wide as possible.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:46.649
So, let's think. There are two ways to measure this model.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.004
One is by how many points it misclassifies,

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.109
and the other one is by how wide the margin is.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.015
So, what are the misclassified points?

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:56.280
Well, there is this red point in the blue area,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.590
and there is this blue point in the red area,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.270
but we also want no points in this margin over here.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.170
So, let's actually punish this points,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.185
which means, we'll make them part of our classification error.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:11.055
So, the yellow circle show you exactly where the classification error is.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:12.925
And now, we have the margin error,

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:14.204
so let's look at this margin.

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:17.549
And basically, we want this margin to be as wide as possible.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.304
We want to include this in the error,

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:20.935
and we'll see how to do this later.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.090
But in a nutshell, our new error for this algorithm

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
is going to be a classification error plus a margin error.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.909
And minimizing this error is what's going to give us

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.420
the algorithm for support vector machine.
