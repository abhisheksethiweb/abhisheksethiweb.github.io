00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.948
Now, let's see how the kernel method works in higher dimensions.

00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:06.404
Here, we still want to draw a mountain at every point.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:11.535
In the 3D case, this mountain is a Gaussian paraboloid and it lifts the points like this.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.995
Then if you want to separate the point from the rest,

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:16.019
we can cut it with a plane.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.179
The plane will intersect the paraboloid at

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.750
a circle and this circle is what will become our boundary.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.240
So if we have more points, we'd do the same.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.229
We use a similar method than before to find the right weights for the combination of

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.940
mountains that will bring the majority of

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.300
the red points up while keeping the majority of the blue points down.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.404
And then we cut this with the plane.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:36.762
When we project down,

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.820
then the intersections of the curve on the plane will

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.030
give us the boundaries that will split our data.
