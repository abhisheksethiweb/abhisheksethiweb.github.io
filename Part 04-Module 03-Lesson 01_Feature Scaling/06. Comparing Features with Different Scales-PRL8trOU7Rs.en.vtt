00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.620
So the way that I got the result that Chris,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.770
should be wearing the same size tee shirt as Sarah rather than Cameron,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.890
is that I compared these numbers that I computed for each of these people.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.020
And I said is Chris closer to Cameron's number or to Sarah's number, and as it

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.980
turns out, he's about 26 away from Sarah and he's about 35 away from Cameron.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.370
Closer to Sarah.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.000
Now what went wrong here is that this metric of height plus weight

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.030
has two very imbalanced features in it, height and weight.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.050
So here's what I mean by that, the height is going to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
be a number that generally goes between let's say, the numbers of five and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.620
seven, the weight, on the other hand, takes on much larger values.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.250
Between 115 and 175 pounds in this example.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.700
So what ends up happening when you compute the sum of the two of them, is that

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.530
the weight almost always will completely dominate the answer that you get.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.470
And height ends up being effectively a rounding error.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.750
Whereas what you probably want is something where the two features are equally

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.430
weighted in, in the sum when you add them together.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490
And this is what feature scaling does.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.180
It's a method for re-scaling features like these ones,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.980
so that they always span comparable ranges, usually between zero and one.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.600
So then, the numbers that you get from height will be between zero and one,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.040
they'll still contain the same information.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.300
But just expressed in different units.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.630
And the weight will also be expressed between zero and one.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.970
Again, you'll still have the information there, that Cameron raised the most and

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.010
Sarah raised the least, but it'll be expressed over this much smaller range.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.480
Then when you add them together,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.420
weight won't completely dominate the equation anymore.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.390
And when that happens, you should get a much more sensible result for

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880
Chris's t-shirt size.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.120
Because even though he's a little bit closer to Sarah in weight,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.520
he's a lot closer to Cameron in height and so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.760
he'll probably end up getting grouped with Cameron.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.340
In the next video I'll show you the equation for feature scaling.
