00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.330
So now, I'm going to give you a programming quiz to have you actually implement

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.140
this yourself using Python.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.600
What I want you to do in this quiz, is to write a function that implements

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.540
a min/max rescaler, which is what we just did by hand.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.350
It transforms the features so they have a range of outputs between 0 and 1.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.670
And the way you do that is using the formula that I just introduced to you.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.310
So I will give you a list of input features, and your function should return

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.130
a list of output features that have been rescaled according to this formula.
