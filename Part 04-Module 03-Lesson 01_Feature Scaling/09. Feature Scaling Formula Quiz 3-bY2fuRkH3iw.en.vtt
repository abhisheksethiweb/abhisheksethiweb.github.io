00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.706
The answer that you get when you us this formula is 0.417.

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:09.410
So 0.417 is the new value of the feature that belongs to the 140 pound person.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.500
So the way we did this is we take our x min and x max.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.010
We plug them into the formula.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.660
And we plug in the 140 as well in the position for the sort of old value of x.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.160
And from that we can compute x prime.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.820
And one of the features of this formula for rescaling features is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.430
that your transform features will always be between 0 and 1.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.220
Now this has some benefits and some disadvantages.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.670
One of the benefits is you have a very reliable number as to what you

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.040
can expect in the output.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.370
One of the disadvantages is that if you have outliers in your input

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.590
features then they can kind of mess up your rescaling because your x min and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.100
your x max might have really extreme values.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.910
So now what I want to do is I want to give you a programming quiz.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.720
Where I have you actually program this up yourself.
