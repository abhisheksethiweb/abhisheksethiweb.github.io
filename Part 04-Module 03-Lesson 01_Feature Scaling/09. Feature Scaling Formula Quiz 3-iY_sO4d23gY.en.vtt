00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.710
And now I want you to use this information to rescale a feature.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.595
So the feature I want you to rescale is to find x prime of 140, so

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:12.010
what is the 140 pound feature after you've done the rescaling?

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.450
Remember, the x min we just found is 115, and x max is 175.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.120
So you figure out what to plug into this formula to find x prime 140,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.640
the rescaled value of the 140 pound person's weight.
