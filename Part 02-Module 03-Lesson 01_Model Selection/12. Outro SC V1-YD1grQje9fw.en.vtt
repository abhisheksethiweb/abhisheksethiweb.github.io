00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
So to summarize, this is how I see machine learning.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.810
We have a problem to solve which is represented by this broken car over

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:10.695
here and we have some tools to fix it which are the algorithms of machine learning.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:13.140
Finally, you have some measurement tools,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.160
which we then use to measure each tool's performance.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.210
Then you pick the best tool to fix your car.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.269
To be more specific in machine learning you have

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.204
a problem which is some data you need to classify.

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:27.079
You also have a bunch of algorithms things like neural networks,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.820
logistic regression, polynomial regression as VMs, decision trees,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.844
random forests et cetera and we have a bunch of metrics,

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:35.765
things like model complexity graphs,

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:38.954
accuracy precision, recall, F1 score,

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:40.759
learning curves et cetera.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:44.649
What you do, is you use these ones to test your models,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.519
see how they're doing, pick the best one and that's what you use to model your data.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.405
Then when you have a new point,

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:54.465
you can predict it's label based on that model.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:56.450
That's it. That's how you test,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.540
evaluate and validate models.
